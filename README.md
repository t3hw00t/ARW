# Agent Hub

Agent Hub is an evolving workspace for research on model training, memory interfaces, and hardware-aware optimization.

## Documentation
- [Training Research Directions](docs/training_research.md)
- [Wiki Structure Plan](docs/wiki_structure.md)

Contributions should keep documentation clear and concise. The GitHub wiki is planned to mirror the docs directory and provide quick navigation.
