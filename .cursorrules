# Assisted, Iterative Coding Rules (mirror of docs/ai/ASSISTED_DEV_GUIDE.md)

- Harness instructions and user overrides take precedence over this file. Follow the harness, then document any deviation so the next agent understands the context.
- Always propose a PLAN (files, changes, risks, tests, docs) before code. When the harness treats a change as a trivial ease-of-use edit, call that out in your response and follow the lightweight exception in docs/ai/ASSISTED_DEV_GUIDE.md.
- When the execution harness explicitly grants a lighter flow or pre-approved permissions, treat that as the governing instruction and state the assumption in your response.
- Implement the smallest DIFF once the PLAN is approved/self‑reviewed.
- Run fmt, clippy -D warnings, and tests when source code changes; summarize results. For docs-only or config text tweaks, state the skipped checks and why they are safe.
- Update rustdoc and docs; add examples where useful.
- Respect default‑deny for file writes, shell, and network unless in scope.
- Keep diffs focused (<~300 lines) and avoid opportunistic refactors.
- Keep public APIs stable unless explicitly marked breaking.
