//! **Typed distributed plugin registration.**
//!
//! This crate provides a way to set up a plugin registry into which plugins
//! can be registered from any source file linked into your application. There
//! does not need to be a central list of all the plugins.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Suppose we are writing a command line flags library and want to allow any
//! source file in the application to register command line flags that are
//! relevant to it.
//!
//! This is the flag registration style used by [gflags] and is better suited
//! for large scale development than maintaining a single central list of flags,
//! as the central list would become an endless source of merge conflicts in an
//! application developed simultaneously by thousands of developers.
//!
//! [gflags]: https://gflags.github.io/gflags/
//!
//! ## Instantiating the plugin registry
//!
//! Let's use a `struct Flag` as the plugin type, which will contain the short
//! name of the flag like `-v`, the full name like `--verbose`, and maybe other
//! information like argument type and help text. We instantiate a plugin
//! registry with an invocation of `inventory::collect!`.
//!
//! ```
//! pub struct Flag {
//!     short: char,
//!     name: &'static str,
//!     /* ... */
//! }
//!
//! impl Flag {
//!     pub const fn new(short: char, name: &'static str) -> Self {
//!         Flag { short, name }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! inventory::collect!(Flag);
//! ```
//!
//! This `collect!` call must be in the same crate that defines the plugin type.
//! This macro does not "run" anything so place it outside of any function body.
//!
//! ## Registering plugins
//!
//! Now any crate with access to the `Flag` type can register flags as a plugin.
//! Plugins can be registered by the same crate that declares the plugin type,
//! or by any downstream crate.
//!
//! ```
//! # struct Flag;
//! #
//! # impl Flag {
//! #     const fn new(short: char, name: &'static str) -> Self {
//! #         Flag
//! #     }
//! # }
//! #
//! # inventory::collect!(Flag);
//! #
//! inventory::submit! {
//!     Flag::new('v', "verbose")
//! }
//! #
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! The `submit!` macro does not "run" anything so place it outside of any
//! function body. In particular, note that all `submit!` invocations across all
//! source files linked into your application all take effect simultaneously. A
//! `submit!` invocation is not a statement that needs to be called from `main`
//! in order to execute.
//!
//! ## Iterating over plugins
//!
//! The value `inventory::iter::<T>` is an iterator with element type `&'static
//! T` that iterates over all plugins registered of type `T`.
//!
//! ```
//! # struct Flag {
//! #     short: char,
//! #     name: &'static str,
//! # }
//! #
//! # inventory::collect!(Flag);
//! #
//! for flag in inventory::iter::<Flag> {
//!     println!("-{}, --{}", flag.short, flag.name);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! There is no guarantee about the order that plugins of the same type are
//! visited by the iterator. They may be visited in any order.
//!
//! ## WebAssembly and constructors
//!
//! `inventory` supports all WebAssembly targets, including
//! `wasm*-unknown-unknown`. However, in unusual circumstances, ensuring that
//! constructors run may require some extra effort. The Wasm linker will
//! synthesize a function `extern "C" unsafe fn __wasm_call_ctors()` which calls
//! all constructors when invoked; this function will *not* be exported from the
//! module unless you do so explicitly. Depending on the result of a heuristic,
//! the linker may or may not insert a call to this function from the beginning
//! of every function that your module exports. Specifically, it regards a
//! module as having "command-style linkage" if:
//!
//! * it is not relocatable;
//! * it is not a position-independent executable;
//! * and it does not call `__wasm_call_ctors`, directly or indirectly, from any
//!   exported function.
//!
//! The linker expects that the embedder will call into a command-style module
//! only once per instantiation. Violation of this expectation can result in
//! `__wasm_call_ctors` being called multiple times. This is dangerous in
//! general, but safe and mostly harmless in the case of constructors generated
//! by `inventory`, which are idempotent.
//!
//! If you are building a module which relies on constructors and may be called
//! into multiple times per instance, you should export `__wasm_call_ctors` (or
//! a wrapper around it) and ensure that the embedder calls it immediately after
//! instantiation. Even though `inventory` may work fine without this, it is
//! still good practice, because it avoids unnecessary overhead from repeated
//! constructor invocation. It also can prevent unsoundness if some of your
//! constructors are generated by other crates or other programming languages.
//!
//! ```
//! #[cfg(target_family = "wasm")]
//! unsafe extern "C" {
//!     fn __wasm_call_ctors();
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     #[cfg(target_family = "wasm")]
//!     unsafe {
//!         __wasm_call_ctors();
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
