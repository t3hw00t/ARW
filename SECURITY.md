# Security Policy

Microsummary: How to report vulnerabilities, our disclosure window, and supported versions. Stable, updated as needed.

- Report privately to security@t3hw00t.dev or via GitHub Security Advisories.
- Please do not open public issues for suspected vulnerabilities.
- We aim to acknowledge within 2 business days and provide a fix or mitigation within 30 days when feasible.
- Supported versions: the latest minor release. Older prereleases receive best‑effort fixes only.

Scope includes the service (`arw-svc`), CLI, schemas, and docs. If your report involves third‑party dependencies, include details so we can coordinate upstream.

Thank you for helping keep ARW users safe.
