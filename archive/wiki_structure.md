Type: Explanation

## Suggested Pages
- Home: Overview and project goals.
- Getting Started: Environment setup, contribution guidelines.
- Training Research: Link to in-repo docs on training options and memory layer experiments.
- Hardware Metrics: Documentation of interface and bus statistics collection.
- Auto-Tuning Strategies: Guides for hardware-aware training and resource optimization.

Each page should be concise, link to relevant repo files, and stay synchronized with the main documentation.
