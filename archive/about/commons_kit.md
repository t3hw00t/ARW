Public‑goods starter catalog: one‑click, privacy‑preserving agent recipes that run on everyday PCs with sensible guardrails.

Initial set (no accounts required)
- Paperwork helper: fills government forms from scanned PDFs (OCR → draft → human review)
- Job application co‑pilot: tailor CV/cover letters; never auto‑apply
- Small‑business inbox triage: draft replies, invoice summaries, calendar holds
- Learning buddy: read‑aloud + summaries, dyslexia‑friendly
- Family admin: bills, warranties, and deadlines dashboard

Distribution
- Native binaries (Win/macOS/Linux) or Docker image for labs/classrooms
- Signed recipe index (static JSON) so communities can curate catalogs

Safety patterns
- Never send private files out; never place orders; never sign in without explicit authorization
- Each recipe ships with a “What this can’t do” box

Why ARW
- Local‑first, cloud‑agnostic; transparent Episodes/state; schema‑driven tool UX; portable installs
