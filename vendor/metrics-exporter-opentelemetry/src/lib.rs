//! # üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏èüéà `metrics-exporter-opentelemetry`
//!
//! The **metrics-exporter-opentelemetry** crate is a [`metrics`] exporter over
//! OpenTelemetry's **metrics** API.
//!
//! ## Warnings
//! - The crate doesn't support the following methods from [`metrics`]:
//!     - [`Counter::absolute`](https://docs.rs/metrics/latest/metrics/struct.Counter.html#method.absolute):
//!       OpenTelemetry doesn't keep track of the value inside of a counter.
//!
//!     - [`Gauge::increment`](https://docs.rs/metrics/latest/metrics/struct.Gauge.html#method.increment),
//!       [`Gauge::decrement`](https://docs.rs/metrics/latest/metrics/struct.Gauge.html#method.decrement):
//!       OpenTelemetry doesn't keep track of the value inside of a gauge.
//!
//!     - [`Histogram::record_many`](https://docs.rs/metrics/latest/metrics/struct.Histogram.html#method.record_many):
//!       OpenTelemetry doesn't support recording multiple histogram points.
//!
//! - The crate provide no-op implementations of the `metrics::Recorder::describe_*` as we
//!   can't modify a constructed counter/gauge/histogram from
//!   `metrics::Recorder::register_*`. The SDK keeps track of it but is internal and isn't
//!   able to be accessed.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! ```rust
//! // Cargo.toml:
//! //
//! // [dependencies]
//! // metrics = "^0"
//! // metrics-exporter-opentelemetry = "^0"
//!
//! use metrics_exporter_opentelemetry::Recorder;
//!
//! # fn main() {
//! // Install a global `metrics` recorder
//! let _ = Recorder::builder("my-app")
//!     .install_global()
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//! let counter = metrics::counter!("hello.world");
//! counter.increment(1);
//! # }
//! ```
