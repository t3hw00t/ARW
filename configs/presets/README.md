Performance Presets (Reference)

ARW presets are applied programmatically at startup and seed environment defaults if unset. This folder holds reference TOML snippets you can source in your own shells or ops tooling if you prefer fileâ€‘based overrides.

- examples.toml: illustrative values for each preset tier.

Note: The application does not read these files directly. They are for operators and packaging scripts.
