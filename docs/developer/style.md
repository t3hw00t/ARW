# Style & Harmony

We aim for a calm, precise experience. Keep visuals understated; let high-impact interactions shine.

Guidelines
- Clarity first: short sentences, mild technical terms.
- Clean lines: avoid visual noise, favor whitespace.
- Gentle emphasis: use callouts and bold sparingly.
- Predictable rhythm: consistent headings, short sections, stable nav.

Documentation tone
- User docs are friendly and practical.
- Developer docs are precise, with code pointers and commands.
- Both avoid jargon unless it adds real value.

Code style (high level)
- Prefer explicit names over cleverness.
- Keep modules small and responsibilities clear.
- Instrument with tracing at boundaries and errors.
