# How We Write Docs (Diátaxis)

Microsummary: Our docs follow Diátaxis — Tutorials, How‑to, Reference, Explanations — so readers and tools land on the right page. Stable.

- Tutorials: learning‑oriented, step‑by‑step journeys (e.g., Quickstart).
- How‑to guides: goal‑oriented, copy‑pasteable steps (e.g., models download, security hardening).
- Reference: accurate, dry listings (API, CLI, config, schemas).
- Explanations: background, tradeoffs, and rationale (architecture and concepts).

New content should declare its type, include a 4–6 line microsummary, and use stable, deterministic headings.
