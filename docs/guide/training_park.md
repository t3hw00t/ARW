# Training Park

Third primary perspective for tuning instincts, memory, and behavior. Focus on impressionistic state, not raw data.

What you see
- Priorities/instincts dials with sparklines
- Retrieval diversity and coverage indicators
- Tool success rates and hallucination risk gauges
- Minimal probe chat; immediate feedback in meters

How it works
- Adjust parameters (e.g., retrieval k/diversity, temperature, tool retry budget)
- See effect live; emit `Training.*` and `Policy.*` events
- Profiles can be “pre‑trained” here and bound to projects/agents

Memory Workbench
- Mount indexes, test retrieval quality, visualize coverage/redundancy
- Export tuned recipes back to agents/projects

Safety
- No dark automation; actions queue for approval when side‑effects are present
