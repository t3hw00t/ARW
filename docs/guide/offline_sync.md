# Offline & Sync

Updated: 2025-09-12
Type: How‑to

Local‑first
- Local read‑models + event journal are authoritative; UI rehydrates from them.

Sync boundaries
- Project‑scoped synchronization; explicit export/import; conflict resolution rules.

Conflicts
- Last‑writer‑wins only for non‑critical state; 3‑way merges for notes/config.
