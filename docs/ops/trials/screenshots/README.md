# Trial Dashboard Snapshots
Updated: 2025-09-25
Type: Asset folder note

Store exported Trial Control Center (or equivalent dashboard) images here during a trial.

- Filename format: `dashboard-YYYY-MM-DD-cohortA.png` (adjust cohort as needed).
- Keep the folder lightweightâ€”only the latest snapshots and any supporting notes.
- Add a short caption in the daily log that references the filename for traceability.

This folder is intentionally empty in the repo; populate it when you run an actual trial.
