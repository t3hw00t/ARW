# Dashboard Snapshot Tips

When you save a screenshot or export from the Trial Control Center, double-check these cues:

- Tile colours match the status in the daily log (green = on target, amber = watch, red = action needed).
- Approvals tile shows count + oldest age.
- Memory tile shows the freshness dial and any “needs background” banner.
- Safety tile lists open guardrail alerts or “None”.
- Pause / Roll back buttons visible in the frame.
- Filename format: `dashboard-YYYY-MM-DD-cohortA.png` (adjust cohort as needed).

Attach snapshots to the daily log or store in `docs/ops/trials/screenshots/`.
