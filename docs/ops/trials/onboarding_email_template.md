Subject: Trial run reminder — getting set up

Hi {{Name}},

Quick reminder for our trial run. Here’s the info you need before we start.

**When & where**
- Trial window: {{dates}}
- Daily sync: {{time}} ({{link}} or “async note”)

**Install & sign in (5 minutes)**
1. Download the latest build: {{download_link}}
2. Run the installer and launch Agent Hub.
3. Paste your access token (expires {{expiry_date}}). If it lapses, reply here for a refresh.
4. Stay in **Guided mode** unless we both agree to flip to Autonomy Lane.

**Helpful links**
- Participant quickstart: {{quickstart_link}}
- Feedback doc: {{feedback_link}}
- Ping me on {{preferred_chat}} if anything feels off

**What to expect**
- The helper may ask for approvals in the right-hand queue. Click **Approve** or **Hold** and add a quick note.
- We only log what we share. Close the app when you finish the session so logs stay tidy.

If anything feels off, pause helpers from the Safeguards tab and DM me immediately.

Happy testing!
