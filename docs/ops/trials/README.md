# Trial Dossier

Updated: 2025-09-26

Use this folder to store lightweight records during the trial. Keep files short and human-friendly so anyone joining mid-stream can catch up.

## What to capture

- Daily stand-up notes (one row per day).
- Incident or pause summaries (what happened, who responded, next steps).
- Dashboard snapshots (PNG exports or links) with the date in the filename.
- Autonomy rehearsals once Gate G4 preparation starts.

## Templates

- `daily_log_template.md` — copy once per day for Cohort A/B.
- `dashboard_snapshot.md` — jot the numbers you expect to see when saving a screenshot.

Store sensitive data elsewhere; this dossier is for coordination only.
