# Trial Stand-up Template

Updated: 2025-10-09
Type: How‑to

Use this outline for our quick daily sync (5–10 minutes). We can keep it in a shared note instead of slides while it’s just us.

1. **Dashboard glance (1 min)**
   - Systems tile
   - Memory tile (coverage + recall meters)
   - Approvals tile (count + oldest age)
   - Safety tile (preset + applied timestamp)

2. **Highlights (3 min)**
   - Wins or insights from helpers
   - Notes from the other person

3. **Approvals & incidents (3 min)**
   - Waiting items over 4 hours
   - Pauses or rollbacks triggered
   - Follow-up owners

4. **Risks & blockers (2 min)**
   - Anything that might derail today’s plan
   - Anything one of us needs from the other

5. **Next steps (1 min)**
   - Agree on who does what before the next check-in

Optional slide order (only if we need slides later):
1. Dashboard screenshot
2. Highlights bullets
3. Approvals & incidents table
4. Risks
5. Next steps
