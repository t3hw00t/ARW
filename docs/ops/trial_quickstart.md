# Trial Quickstart

Updated: 2025-09-26
Type: Participant guide

Welcome to the Agent Hub trial. This one-page guide helps you get started in five minutes.

## 1. Install & Sign In

1. Download the latest release from the link your coordinator shared.
2. Run the installer and launch Agent Hub.
3. Enter the access token provided to you (expires on the date noted in the welcome email).
4. Stay in **Guided mode** unless a facilitator asks you to switch.

## 2. Your Home Screen

- **Overview tab** – shows the status tray (“All good” means you’re set), “What’s in focus,” and quick links.
- **Workflows tab** – start a Recipe, review helper progress, or drop notes for the team.
- **Safeguards tab** – pause helpers, see approvals waiting, and read the safety checklist.

## 3. Running a Recipe

1. Go to the Workflows tab and choose the recipe your team assigned.
2. Press **Start** and stay nearby. The helper may ask for approvals.
3. When a card appears in the right-hand queue, read the summary, click **Approve** or **Hold**, and add notes if needed.

## 4. Sharing Findings

- Use the **Feedback** button (bottom-right corner) or add bullets to the shared doc link in the welcome email.
- If you spot confusing language or behaviour, note the time so the ops team can review logs.

## 5. Emergencies

- If something feels wrong, open the Safeguards tab and click **Pause helpers**.
- Ping the on-call teammate listed in the welcome email or runbook contact list.

## Quick Reminders

- Trials last only during the scheduled window; close the app when you’re done.
- We only log the files and links you explicitly share with the helper.
- Your token may expire early if unused—ask for a refresh if needed.

Enjoy the trial—and thank you for the feedback!
