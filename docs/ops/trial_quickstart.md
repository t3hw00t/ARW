# Trial Quickstart

Updated: 2025-09-26
Type: Participant guide

It’s just the two of us in this trial, but keep this one-page guide handy so either person can get started in five minutes.

## 1. Install & Sign In

1. Download the latest release from our shared link (see the prep note).
2. Run the installer and launch Agent Hub.
3. Enter the access token we generated for this run (see the prep note for the expiry date).
4. Stay in **Guided mode** unless we explicitly agree to test Autonomy Lane.

## 2. Your Home Screen

- **Overview tab** – shows the status tray (“All good” means you’re set), “What’s in focus,” and quick links.
- **Workflows tab** – start a Recipe, review helper progress, or drop notes for the team.
- **Safeguards tab** – pause helpers, see approvals waiting, and read the safety checklist.

## 3. Running a Recipe

1. Go to the Workflows tab and choose the recipe your team assigned.
2. Press **Start** and stay nearby. The helper may ask for approvals.
3. When a card appears in the right-hand queue, read the summary, click **Approve** or **Hold**, and add notes if needed.

## 4. Sharing Findings

- Use the **Feedback** button (bottom-right corner) or add bullets to our shared notes doc.
- If you spot confusing language or behaviour, note the time so we can review logs later.

## 5. Emergencies

- If something feels wrong, open the Safeguards tab and click **Pause helpers**, then DM the other person right away.

## Quick Reminders

- Trials last only during the scheduled window we picked; close the app when you’re done.
- We only log the files and links you explicitly share with the helper.
- Tokens may expire early if unused—regenerate one in the shared vault if that happens.

Enjoy the trial—and thank you for the feedback!
