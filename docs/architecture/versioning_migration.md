# Versioning & Migration
Updated: 2025-09-15
Type: Explanation

Everything versioned
- Prompts, recipes, policies, flows, tool schemas — add‑only evolution; semver for operations.

Effective config
- Each episode stores the effective config (model hash/quant, tool versions, policies, recipes, seeds) for deterministic replay.

Migrations
- Schema migrations are additive; deprecations carry links and min maintenance windows.
