# Naming & IDs
Updated: 2025-09-16
Type: Explanation

IDs
- Short, unique, stable; type prefixes when helpful (proj_, agent_, art_, run_).
- Correlation IDs for episodes; human‑readable slugs for projects and agents.

Paths
- Deterministic file paths by scope: `user://`, `project://`, `agent://`.

Events
- Include `id`, `corr_id`, and `code` consistently for easy cross‑linking.
