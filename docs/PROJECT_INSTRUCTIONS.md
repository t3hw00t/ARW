<!-- ARW_UNINTRUSIVE -->
## Unintrusive Operation (System‑Friendly)

- **Per‑user install** by default; no admin rights required for core features.
- **No background services** unless explicitly enabled by the user.
- **No system‑wide settings/registry writes** (beyond optional user actions).
- **Portable mode** supported: all state under a single user/app folder.
- **Explicit network egress** (policy‑gated allowlist); consent for new capabilities.
- **Clean uninstall**: delete the ARW folder (portable mode) or the per‑user state directories.
