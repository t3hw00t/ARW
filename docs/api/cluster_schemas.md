Status: Planned

Node Manifest (signed)
- [spec/schemas/cluster_node_manifest.json](https://github.com/t3hw00t/ARW/blob/main/spec/schemas/cluster_node_manifest.json)
- Use for attestation/pinning: scheduler targets only nodes whose manifest matches the workspace spec; Home Node verifies signatures against the trust store.

Events (planned)
- `cluster.manifest.published`, `cluster.manifest.trusted`, `cluster.manifest.rejected`
