# Training Research Directions

This document outlines initial high-level training options and research ideas for the Agent Hub project.

Updated: 2025-09-12

## Goals
- Explore hardware-conscious training strategies.
- Investigate memory-layer interfaces and bus statistics for optimization.
- Design auto-tuning mechanisms that adapt to resource constraints.

## High-Level Training Options
1. Transfer Learning Pipelines: Provide templates for fine-tuning pre-trained models on new domains.
2. Curriculum Learning Modules: Implement schedulers that gradually increase task difficulty.
3. Distributed Training Hooks: Offer abstraction layers for multi-GPU or multi-node setups.

## Memory Layer Engagement
- Implement pluggable memory modules with configurable retention policies.
- Track read/write patterns to inform memory pruning and caching strategies.
- Expose interfaces for collecting bus utilization metrics during training.

## Hardware-Aware Auto-Tuning
- Profile GPU/CPU utilization and dynamically adjust batch sizes or precision.
- Experiment with mixed-precision and sparsity-aware kernels.
- Collect interface and bus statistics to guide bandwidth-friendly scheduling.
