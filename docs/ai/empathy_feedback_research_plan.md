# Empathy Feedback Loop Research Plan
Updated: 2025-10-18
Type: Reference
Owner: Design/Research Guild  
Status: Draft

## Purpose
Validate the “vibe feedback” concept and persona card UX before enabling empathy telemetry. We need evidence that users understand the controls, trust the system with emotional signals, and can recover from misalignment quickly.

## Research Questions
1. Do participants understand what the persona card and vibe controls represent?
2. Can they successfully adjust tone/pacing/formality to reach a desired interaction style?
3. Does the system explain how empathy telemetry is collected and protected?
4. Are there accessibility or inclusion issues (screen readers, cognitive load, cultural expectations)?
5. How do collaborators reconcile conflicting feedback when sharing a workspace?

## Method
- **Format:** Moderated remote sessions (60 minutes) with thinking-aloud prompts.
- **Participants:** 12 total
  - 4 solo builders (non-technical, creative)
  - 4 technical operators (developers/analysts)
  - 4 accessibility-focused participants (screen reader, keyboard-only, neurodiverse)
- **Tools:** Prototype branch of Launcher with persona card + vibe widget behind `ARW_PERSONA_ENABLE`, telemetry disabled (simulate metrics).
- **Session Flow:**
  1. Warm-up: intro, consent, baseline attitude toward empathetic AI.
  2. Task 1: Explore persona card, identify traits, discuss understanding.
  3. Task 2: Use vibe controls to adjust agent behavior (scripted scenario).
  4. Task 3: Review telemetry consent sheet, answer comprehension questions.
  5. Task 4: Resolve persona change conflict (collaborator has opposing feedback).
  6. Debrief: trust rating, privacy comfort, suggestions.

## Metrics
- **Success criteria:**
  - ≥75% of participants adjust tone/pacing correctly without facilitator intervention.
  - ≥80% correctly articulate telemetry scope and retention after review.
  - SUS score ≥70 for persona card/vibe widget.
  - Accessibility heuristics: zero critical blocking issues, ≤2 major issues.
- **Qualitative signals:**
  - Trust delta (pre/post self-reported).
  - Confidence in persona alignment (Likert scale).
  - Thematic coding on transparency, control, emotional comfort.

## Data Handling
- Recordings stored in encrypted research vault; transcripts anonymized within 48 hours.
- Empathy feedback logs are simulated; no real sentiment data collected.
- Participants sign lightweight consent describing prototype data handling.
- Findings summarized in aggregate; quotes anonymized with persona types only.

## Timeline
- Week 1: Finalize prototype + research scripts, recruit participants.
- Week 2: Conduct sessions (3 per day max).
- Week 3: Synthesize findings, produce empathy design language draft.
- Week 4: Feed insights into persona RFC grooming and UI backlog items.

## Deliverables
- Research report (PDF + markdown summary in `docs/ai/empathy_feedback_findings.md`).
- Updated empathy design language section for docs.
- Issue updates linking findings to `Persona & Empathy` backlog items.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Prototype drift**: Keep prototype branch aligned with RFC; schedule daily sync with engineering.
- **Safety concerns**: Provide crisis resources in consent form; allow immediate opt-out.
- **Bias**: Ensure diverse recruitment channels and review script with inclusion specialists.

## Coordination
- Research Facilitator: TBD
- Kernel liaison: ensure telemetry stubs align with planned API.
- Accessibility champion: audit controls before participant sessions.
- Ethics review: brief the privacy council on consent copy and data retention.
