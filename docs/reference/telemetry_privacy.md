Microsummary: What’s logged in the event journal, how to disable, and retention defaults. Beta.

- Local‑first: no automatic network egress; logs stay local by default.
- Event journal: records episodes and key events for debugging; can be disabled or rotated.
- Disable/Configure: see `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` (journal section) and `ARW_DEBUG` notes.
- Retention: defaults to per‑user storage path; configure size/time limits in configuration.
