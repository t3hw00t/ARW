# Interface Deprecations

Updated: 2025-10-18
Status: Stable
Type: Reference

Microsummary:
- Authoritative list of HTTP operations flagged as deprecated in the OpenAPI spec.
- Shows method, path, primary tag, optional sunset, and summary to guide migrations.
- Embeds a stable spec hash so CI can detect drift without timestamp churn.
- Refresh with `just docs-deprecations` (python3 scripts/generate_deprecations.py) after spec changes.

_Generated from spec/openapi.yaml (sha256:ce5fa7cb37ff). Do not edit._

When an operation is marked deprecated, the runtime emits standard headers (Deprecation, optionally Sunset and Link rel="deprecation").

No deprecated endpoints.
