# Goal <-> Roadmap <-> Tasks

Updated: 2025-10-24
Type: Reference

This crosswalk keeps the four ARW pillars in view by linking each goal to the roadmap themes and the concrete tasks now tracking delivery. Use it as the live hand-off between vision docs, planning boards, and day-to-day execution.

## Goals At A Glance

- **G1 - Augment any model with personally managed memory and persona growth.**
- **G2 - Provide an empathetic, human-first interface for every user.**
- **G3 - Enable anyone to earn safely with autonomous agents and shared resources.**
- **G4 - Guarantee free, sustainable access on consumer-grade hardware.**

## Keeping It Current

- When you add or retire a major roadmap item, update this table so contributors see the downstream ripple immediately.
- New task IDs that support a pillar should be added here (and to `.arw/tasks.json`) in the same change.
- If a goal needs reshaping, start with the vision statement in [docs/RESTRUCTURE.md](RESTRUCTURE.md) and reflect the change here, in the README pillars, and in the backlog badges.
