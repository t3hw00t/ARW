This roadmap consolidates user-facing interface concepts to guide a unified, accessible experience across the service, tray app, and debug tooling.

## Short‑Term (0–3 Months)
- Guided micro-tutorials for first-time features
- Micro-satisfaction elements (light animations, haptic feedback)
- Contextual tray actions with recent commands
- Inline doc hints and contextual tooltips
- Command palette/quick-action menu in tray app

## Medium‑Term (3–6 Months)
- Multi-modal input (voice, stylus, gesture)
- Predictive autoflow suggestions
- Progressive disclosure interface pattern
- Tiled debug surface with rearrangeable panels
- Live linting for macros and one-click tool sandboxing
- Integrated monitoring/analytics modules
- Voice/terminal parity for key commands

## Long‑Term (6+ Months)
- Timeline-based activity stream with timeline scrubber
- Dynamic flow view and declarative recipe builder
- Real-time collaboration cues and shareable debug sessions
- Cross-device handoff of in-progress sessions
- Minimal offline docs packaged with app
- Inline node graph visualization of agent events
- Comprehensive debug session export/import
- Dynamic "what-if" runs branching from historical states
