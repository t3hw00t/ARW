This roadmap consolidates user-facing interface concepts to guide a unified, accessible experience across the service, launcher, and debug tooling.

## Short‑Term (0–3 Months)
- [Pack: Collaboration] Guided micro-tutorials for first-time features
- [Pack: Collaboration] Micro-satisfaction elements (light animations, haptic feedback)
- [Pack: Collaboration] Contextual launcher tray actions with recent commands
- [Pack: Collaboration] Inline doc hints and contextual tooltips
- [Pack: Collaboration] Command palette/quick-action menu in the launcher
 - [Pack: Collaboration] Canonical admin routes: `/admin/debug`, `/admin/ui/*` (keep clear dev aliases)
 - [Pack: Collaboration] SSE robustness: status badges + auto-reconnect with backoff and Last-Event-ID resume
 - [Pack: Collaboration] Connections: per-connection admin token and open app windows for that base
 - [Pack: Collaboration] Schema-generated forms from OpenAPI for consistent parameter UIs

## Medium‑Term (3–6 Months)
- [Pack: Collaboration] Multi-modal input (voice, stylus, gesture)
- [Pack: Collaboration] Predictive autoflow suggestions
- [Pack: Collaboration] Progressive disclosure interface pattern
- [Pack: Collaboration] Tiled debug surface with rearrangeable panels
- [Pack: Collaboration] Live linting for macros and one-click tool sandboxing
- [Pack: Collaboration] Integrated monitoring/analytics modules
- [Pack: Collaboration] Voice/terminal parity for key commands

## Long‑Term (6+ Months)
- [Pack: Collaboration] Timeline-based activity stream with timeline scrubber
- [Pack: Collaboration] Dynamic flow view and declarative recipe builder
- [Pack: Collaboration] Real-time collaboration cues and shareable debug sessions
- [Pack: Collaboration] Cross-device handoff of in-progress sessions
- [Pack: Collaboration] Minimal offline docs packaged with app
- [Pack: Collaboration] Inline node graph visualization of agent events
- [Pack: Collaboration] Comprehensive debug session export/import
- [Pack: Collaboration] Dynamic "what-if" runs branching from historical states
