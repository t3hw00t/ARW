# Agents Running Wild (ARW)

ARW is a lightweight, local agent service and CLI. It focuses on beauty, harmony, and safe performance: clean lines, subtle interactions, and responsive behavior.

What you can expect
- Simple, local-first service with a small, friendly UI.
- Tools registered via a macro and discovered at runtime.
- Clear packaging and portable state for easy sharing.

Start with Quickstart to run the service, then explore the features and deployment notes. When you’re ready to dive deeper, the Developer section explains the workspace and CI.

Tip: If you’re just trying ARW, the default paths are portable. You can switch between portable and system mode with a single environment variable.
