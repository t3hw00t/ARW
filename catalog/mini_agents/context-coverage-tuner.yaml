summary: Tune retrieval diversity to lift slot coverage for long-running projects.
description: >
  This mini-agent trains the retrieval governor to close coverage gaps by exploring diversity and
  recency weights alongside compression budgets. It is designed for teams that rely on the modular
  context working set and want guardrails that keep important slots filled without overfetching or
  blowing past token budgets.
